    - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with R on ~1 million records of transplantations retrieved from the United Network for Organ Sharing database
    - Determined the key factors of different waiting times among less populated, moderately populated and more centralized states by creating heat maps of waitlist patients per capita with Tableau
    - Built a prediction model to estimate waiting time with an ideal goodness of fit by fitting data to JMP statistical software
    - Evaluated transplant matching ratios by given dates; Results showed that 35.7% of the patients were predicted to match within the first year, and 89% would be matched by their 5th year on the waiting list
    - Proposed an event tree to calculate the overall probabilities of transplant success, failure, and failure to match of a given patient
    - Addressed the preceding issues of information asymmetry in the organ donation practice by capturing the dynamic likelihoods and risks in kidney transplants
