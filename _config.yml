  Elaine Y. Liang is currently pursuing her master’s degree in Industrial Engineering at Texas A&M University (College Station, TX). She often thinks the world is a gigantic machine, which consists of multiple subsystems and is always curious about how humans interact within. Besides spending her time mind-wandering, she also enjoys playing the cello, brewing coffee, and walking.
