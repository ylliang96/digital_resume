  Elaine Yi-Lien Liang received her Master of Science (M.S.) in Industrial Engineering from Texas A&M University (College Station, TX). She often thinks the world is a gigantic, sophisticated system, which consists of multiple subsystems and is always curious about how humans interact within. Besides spending her time mind-wandering, she also enjoys playing the cello, brewing coffee, rock climbing and walking. &#127931; &#9749;  &#129495; &#128694; <i>(Last edited on 10/10/21)</i>
